# Trend-Analysis-in-SQL
I have created an e-commerce database. I will analyze this data and answer important questions that can help a business in a real-world scenario.

**Goal of the project**

**Understand Customer Behavior:** By analyzing the total number of orders per customer, the top customers by number of orders, and customers who have ordered more than 5 times, you aim to understand the purchasing habits of your customers. This can help in identifying loyal customers and understanding customer retention.

**Analyze Product Performance:** By calculating the total sales per product, the most popular product, and identifying products that have never been ordered, you aim to understand which products are performing well and which are not. This can guide inventory management and marketing efforts.

**Evaluate Sales Performance:** By calculating the total revenue per location, sales per day, and monthly sales trends, you aim to understand how sales performance varies over time and across different locations. This can help in identifying seasonal trends or regional preferences.

**Assess Order Value:** By calculating the average order value and average order value per location, you aim to understand the typical revenue generated from each order. This can provide insights into pricing strategies and regional purchasing power.

**Examine Purchase Details:** By listing customer purchases with product details and orders per location with customer details, you aim to get a detailed view of what customers are buying and where they are located. This can help in personalizing marketing efforts and improving customer service.

**Sample Output:**
